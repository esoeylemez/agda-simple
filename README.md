Agda-Simple
===========

This is my Agda base library with the following goals/features:

  * As the name suggests, it is simple in a specific sense: very little
    indirection, very few auxiliary definitions, even very few modules.

  * Focus on theorem proving, not programming.

  * Sparing use of Unicode: only a few well-known operators, no Unicode
    subscripts or brackets.

Bug reports, comments and contributions are welcome!
